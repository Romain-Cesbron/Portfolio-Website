                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Romain. I was born in France and currently live in Cork, Ireland. Originally, I studied biology and genetics, but I have since discovered a passion for programming. My background in science has taught me to be a meticulous and analytical thinker, skills that I now apply to coding. I believe my best quality is that I am a fast learner, which has helped me quickly adapt to this new field.<br>
                    I am looking for a company where I can enjoy my work, learn lots of things and have opportunities for career advancement.</p>

                                I have extensive experience with genetic studies and stem cell research, along with a strong foundation in cellular biology, including cell genesis, chromosome structure, and developmental biology. My knowledge extends to human biology, where I understand how organs work together across different systems and layers. I also have a basic understanding of cancerology and immunology, which gives me insight into disease mechanisms and immune responses. I have a basic understanding of statistical analysisâ€”I know enough to do simple statistical analyses and interpret the results effectively.<br>
                                Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by evolutionary biology, especially natural selection and genetic drift. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time studying these topics, and theyâ€™re something I really enjoy diving into. </p>

                                I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows me to create websites easily. JavaScript is definitely my favorite, I love how dynamic and interactive it can make a site.<br>
                                I have a basic knowledge of Firebase, so I can set up small databases when needed.<br><br>
                                Iâ€™m currently learning Python, and below youâ€™ll find some of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on.<br><br>
                                I got started with coding by following online courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into projects on my own. Iâ€™ll admit, Iâ€™m not the best at creating visually stunning pages with CSS, but I try my best and often learn by experimenting and borrowing ideas from other website.<br><br>
                                What I love most about programming is that thereâ€™s always more than one way to solve a problem. Whether you want to dive into complex code or find a clever workaround, itâ€™s all about choosing the right approach. Plus, no matter what bug you run into, thereâ€™s always a solution out thereâ€”you just have to find it!

                                For this project, I used the Stripe API to create a checkout page. The shopping cart information is first collected using JavaScript and then sent to a Python server, which uses the Stripe API to process the payment.<br>
                                This website's UI is simplified to demonstrate functionality. The checkout is in test mode and does not work with a regular credit card. To test it, you can use a Stripe test card:

                            <h3>Data Analysis with Python</h3>
                            <p>
                                In this project, I analyzed data from over 1,000 basketball matches to determine if the betting odds were accurate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I used Python's data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, to group the data and create graphs.

                            <h3>Incremental Game Website</h3>
                            <p>
                                This project is my take on the "Cookie Clicker" genre of incremental games. In "Cookie Clicker," users initially click on a big cookie on the screen, earning a single cookie per click. They can then use their earned cookies to purchase assets that automatically produce cookies.<br>
                                I designed my website to look like a Wikipedia page to learn how to replicate a design and layout. I created the website from scratch without directly copying any elements from Wikipedia.<br>
                                I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for this project. I utilized local storage to remember the game state, so even if you close your browser, your game won't start from scratch.<br>
                                At the end, I connected the project to Firebase to create a working leaderboard, which allowed me to learn a bit about backend development.

                            My best quality is that I am a fast learner. I believe I can adapt quickly to different environments. I am good with technology, which helps me in my current job where I had to learn and teach how a payment processor works. I am drawn to new technologies and love to explore new tools and gadgets.<br>
                            Even though I am not the best at designing websites, I consider myself a creative person who loves to make things. One of my hobbies is repairing electronic devices, which, with the help of the internet, is quite rewarding when successful.<br>
                            I have a driving license and enjoy sports such as ping pong, tennis, and running. I really like living in Ireland, especially during the summer, and would love to continue living here.
